# tip-generator-app

An application built using React and Apollo graphql to produce insights on the over 2.5 goals markets. The application is linked to a backend using nodejs, graphql and mongoDB which processes data from previous matches to produce insights on whether any upcoming matches could result in being over 2.5 goals.

This project was inspired by wanting to produce an accurate algorithm which would produce long correct results and the opportunity to explore machine learning.
